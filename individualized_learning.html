  <h2>Welcome &amp; Context</h2>

  <p>
    This mini-session explores how generative AI can help create individualized learning pathways,
    with a special focus on accessibility and support for neurodiverse learners. You’ll experiment
    with prompts, examine benefits and limitations, and connect what you learn to an educational
    intervention you might design for your final project.
  </p>

  <h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to at least one AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.).</li>
    <li>A real or hypothetical learning context you care about (course, tutoring, informal learning space, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe how AI can support individualized, multimodal learning pathways.</li>
    <li>Identify ways these pathways can benefit neurodiverse learners.</li>
    <li>Practice prompts that generate supports without asking AI to diagnose or label anyone.</li>
    <li>Articulate at least one benefit and one challenge of using AI in this way.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Do not share sensitive personal or health information with AI tools.
    When in doubt, frame situations as hypothetical: <em>“Imagine a student who…”</em> rather than
    providing real names or diagnoses.

  <h2>Activity 1: Mapping Learner Variability</h2>
  <div class="activity-meta">Time: ~5 minutes</div>

  <h3>Quick Concept: Neurodiversity and Learning Barriers</h3>
  <p>
    Neurodiversity is the idea that there is natural variation in how human brains process information,
    focus, plan, and experience the world. In learning environments, this shows up as different needs
    around executive function, working memory, sensory load, social interaction, and communication styles.
  </p>

  <h3>Your Task: Describe a Learning Challenge</h3>
  <p>
    Think of a learner (real or hypothetical) who struggles in a current educational context.
    You don’t need to name a diagnosis. Instead, describe what makes learning hard.
  </p>

  <h4>Prompt to Try</h4>
  <div class="prompt-block">
You are an educational psychologist who specializes in learner variability and neurodiversity.
I will describe a student and a learning context. Your job is NOT to diagnose anything,
but to identify possible learning barriers and cognitive demands in plain language.

Here is the situation:
[Describe a student and context in 3–5 sentences – e.g., large lectures, heavy reading, group work, online modules, etc.]

Identify three likely barriers this student might face and explain how each barrier could affect their learning experience.
  </div>

  <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Did the AI identify barriers you hadn’t considered?</li>
    <li>Which parts of the response felt grounded vs. speculative?</li>
    <li>How might these barriers show up in your own context?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Before designing AI-supported pathways, you need a clear picture of the barriers, not just the content.</p>

  <h2>Activity 2: Using AI to Reshape Modality &amp; Scaffolding</h2>
  <div class="activity-meta">Time: ~8 minutes</div>

  <h3>Quick Concept: Multimodal Support as Pathway</h3>
  <p>
    Individualized pathways are not just “different speeds” through the same content. They can involve
    changing modalities (text, audio, visual, interactive), chunking information differently, and adding
    scaffolds that reduce cognitive load. AI tools can often transform the same concept into multiple forms.
  </p>

  <h3>Try This: One Concept, Multiple Modalities</h3>
  <p>
    Pick a concept from your own discipline (e.g., “working memory”, “photosynthesis”, “opportunity cost”,
    “color contrast ratio”). Use AI to generate several versions aimed at a hypothetical learner who has
    specific support needs.
  </p>

  <h4>Prompt 1 – Plain Language + Structure</h4>
  <div class="prompt-block">
You are a supportive learning coach. Explain the concept of “[YOUR CONCEPT]”
to a college student who finds dense text and long paragraphs overwhelming.

Constraints:
- Use short paragraphs and clear headings.
- Avoid jargon or define it briefly.
- End with 3 bullet points that summarize the main idea.
  </div>

  <h4>Prompt 2 – Visual &amp; Spatial Metaphor</h4>
  <div class="prompt-block">
Act as an educator designing supports for a neurodiverse learner who thinks best with visuals.
Explain “[YOUR CONCEPT]” using a visual metaphor or diagram description.
Describe what the diagram would look like so that someone could sketch it,
and explain how each part of the diagram maps to the concept.
  </div>

  <h4>Prompt 3 – Step-by-Step Scaffolding</h4>
  <div class="prompt-block">
Imagine a student who gets overwhelmed when too many steps are presented at once.
Create a step-by-step pathway to understand “[YOUR CONCEPT]” in 5–7 small steps.

For each step, include:
1) What the student should focus on,
2) A simple example,
3) A quick self-check question to see if they understood that step before moving on.
  </div>

  <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Which version would help a learner who struggles with reading? With working memory? With anxiety?</li>
    <li>Where did the AI’s scaffolding feel helpful, and where did it risk oversimplifying?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> AI can help you remix the same idea into different forms, but you still have to decide which form aligns with a specific learner’s needs and goals.</p>

  <h2>Activity 3: Designing a Tiny Individualized Pathway</h2>
  <div class="activity-meta">Time: ~8 minutes</div>

  <h3>Quick Concept: Pathways as Sequences, Not One-Off Prompts</h3>
  <p>
    An individualized pathway is more than a single “good prompt.” It’s a sequence of interactions that
    adapt as the learner progresses: checking understanding, switching modalities, offering choices,
    and revisiting sticking points.
  </p>

  <h3>Your Task: Co-Design a Micro-Pathway</h3>
  <p>
    Choose a short learning goal (something a student could achieve in 15–30 minutes), such as
    “understand how to use the color contrast checker in web design” or “practice retrieving key terms
    for an exam.” Then use AI to outline a pathway for a hypothetical neurodiverse learner.
  </p>

  <h4>Prompt: Micro-Pathway Design</h4>
  <div class="prompt-block">
You are an instructional designer creating a short, individualized learning pathway
for a neurodiverse college student.

Goal:
[Describe a small, concrete learning goal in 1–2 sentences.]

Learner profile (hypothetical, no diagnosis labels needed):
[Describe 3–4 characteristics – e.g., struggles with long reading, easily overwhelmed by cluttered interfaces,
benefits from repetition and concrete examples, prefers written text + simple diagrams, etc.]

Design a step-by-step pathway that:
- Uses at least two different modalities (e.g., text + visual, text + audio, interactive practice).
- Includes quick checks for understanding after major steps.
- Offers at least two “choice points” where the learner can pick how to continue.
- Stays realistic for 15–30 minutes of focused work.

Present your answer as a numbered list of steps with brief explanations.
  </div>

  <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Where does the AI’s pathway feel human-centered and realistic?</li>
    <li>Where does it make assumptions you’d want to challenge or refine?</li>
    <li>What would you keep, modify, or remove if you implemented this pathway with real learners?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> AI can sketch plausible pathways quickly, but human designers must refine them, add guardrails, and align them with real constraints.</p>

<section id="activity4">
  <h2>Activity 4: Benefits, Risks, and Guardrails</h2>
  <div class="activity-meta">Time: ~7 minutes</div>

  <h3>Quick Concept: Promise and Peril</h3>
  <p>
    AI-supported individualized pathways can expand access and reduce barriers, especially for neurodiverse learners.
    But they also introduce risks: incorrect guidance, over-dependence, unexamined bias, and privacy concerns around
    sensitive learner information.
  </p>

  <h3>Try This: Surface Benefits and Challenges</h3>

  <h4>Prompt 1 – Benefits &amp; Failure Modes</h4>
  <div class="prompt-block">
You are a critical friend to an instructor who wants to use AI to support neurodiverse learners
with individualized pathways.

In a balanced way, list:
1) 5 potential benefits of using AI in this way, focusing on access, flexibility, and learner agency.
2) 5 potential risks or failure modes, including equity, privacy, over-scaffolding, and misalignment with goals.

For each risk, briefly suggest one concrete guardrail or mitigation strategy.
  </div>

  <h4>Prompt 2 – Drafting Guardrails</h4>
  <div class="prompt-block">
Based on the benefits and risks above, help me draft a short set of “AI guardrails”
for designing individualized learning pathways for neurodiverse learners in higher education.

Keep it to 6–8 bullet points.
Each bullet should:
- Start with “I will…” or “We will…”
- Describe a specific design or evaluation practice (not a vague principle).
  </div>

  <h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Which guardrails feel essential for your context?</li>
    <li>What’s missing from the AI’s list of risks?</li>
    <li>Where might institutional policies or disability services need to be consulted?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Individualized pathways are powerful but not neutral. You need explicit guardrails to keep them ethical, accessible, and aligned with real learners’ needs.</p>
