  <h1>AI & Education: The Coming Impact</h1>
  <p>Exploring how artificial intelligence is reshaping teaching, learning, and institutions</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Personalized Learning & Scale</h2>
    <p>AI offers the potential to tailor instruction, support individual learners at scale, and free up educators to focus on higher-order learning and human connection.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “We need to develop new pedagogies that can positively leverage AI while still allowing learning to occur.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— Morgan Kelly, Dartmouth College (2025) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</div>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
      “AI will undoubtedly reshape the way schools deliver instruction, track progress, and expand access. But two priorities remain non-negotiable: human connection and compliance with student protections.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— From recent commentary (September 2025) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Critical Thinking & Ethical Use</h2>
    <p>It’s not enough to use AI — we have to ensure students are learning *how* to use it, when to rely on it, and how to stay aware of its limitations.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “At a metacognitive level, students … need to understand when they can use AI to just get a task done, and when and how they should use it for long-term learning.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— Morgan Kelly, Dartmouth College (2025) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</div>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
      “When educators talk about artificial intelligence … that excitement must be matched with caution, context, and critical awareness.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— Stephanie Smith Budhai & Marie Heath (October 2025) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Institutional Change & Policy</h2>
    <p>AI isn’t just a tool to plug into classrooms — it changes how institutions operate, how educators teach, and how we frame policy around learning at scale.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “AI is what I have called an ‘arrival technology.’ AI is not invited into schools through a process of adoption … it crashes the party and then starts rearranging the furniture.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— Commentary (October 2025) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</div>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
      “Remember that, as an education leader, your procurement dollars are your power … You are ultimately responsible for everything you create with AI. Always be transparent about if and how you used AI.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— Vera Cubero (2025) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Challenges & Equity</h2>
    <p>With great power comes great responsibility: we must guard against inequities, over-reliance on automation, bias in algorithms, and erosion of human-centered learning.</p>
    <div class="quote">
      “Six journalism professors … tell us how AI is shifting how we train the journalists of tomorrow.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— From a report on journalism education & AI (September 2025) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</div>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">
      “There is an illusion of mastery when we cognitively outsource all of our thinking and learning to AI, but we’re not really learning.”  
      <div class="quote-author">— Morgan Kelly, Dartmouth College (2025) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</div>
