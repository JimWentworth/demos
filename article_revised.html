    <h1>Polish Less, Verify More: A New Approach to AI-Supported Writing</h1>

    <p>Thanks to AI tools like ChatGPT, students now have powerful assistants for structuring thoughts, smoothing out sentences, and correcting grammar. As a result, we're seeing more polished submissions—<em>complete with the obligatory em dash</em>—and that’s a good thing.</p>

    <p>But polish and fluency are no longer the gatekeepers of strong writing. With that groundwork laid, we can now shift the focus toward deeper opportunities: cultivating <strong>credibility</strong>, <strong>precision</strong>, and a practiced skepticism toward AI-generated claims.</p>

    <p>This shift opens new routes for meaningful engagement. Students can learn to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distinguish between plausible-sounding text and verifiable truth</li>
        <li>Use AI as a first draft partner—but not the final authority</li>
        <li>Cross-check claims using trusted sources and cite those findings clearly</li>
        <li>Reflect on what was generated vs. what was discovered</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To mirror this evolution in writing practices, we’re updating how we evaluate student work. The balance is tipping:</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="accuracy_pie_chart.svg" alt="Pie chart showing 90% for accuracy and 10% for fluency">
        <figcaption>Even the most polished AI writing isn't useful if it can't be trusted. Accuracy is the new currency.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Sure, we still appreciate clean grammar and tidy transitions. But we now grade with a much heavier emphasis on the quality of thought behind the words—especially the ability to validate and defend the information presented.</p>

    <blockquote>
        “AI can polish your prose, but it can’t verify your facts. That’s your job.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>This isn’t a crackdown—it’s an invitation. An invitation to think more critically, to research more thoroughly, and to bring one’s own judgment into the writing process. Because in this new landscape, the best writing isn’t just readable—it’s reliable.</p>
