    <h1>Polish Less, Verify More: A New Approach to AI-Supported Writing</h1>
    <p>Now that students have access to AI tools like ChatGPT, the writing process is evolving rapidly. These tools can help structure arguments, clean up grammar, and improve the flow of writing. As a result, we're seeing more polished submissions—and that’s a good thing.</p>

    <p>But polish is no longer the primary hurdle. The real skill lies in ensuring <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>verifiability</strong>. Can students detect when AI makes something up? Can they verify facts and cite credible sources to support AI-generated content?</p>

    <p>To reflect this shift, we’re adjusting our grading expectations. Yes, we still value fluency—but we value <strong>truth</strong> more. That means students are now responsible for fact-checking what AI helps them create.</p>

        <figcaption>Even the most polished AI writing isn't useful if it can't be trusted. Accuracy is the new currency.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>This shift doesn’t penalize students for using AI—it challenges them to use it <em>well</em>. In a world where tools can help them write faster, we expect them to think deeper.</p>
