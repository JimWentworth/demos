    <title>Deconstructing Reality: An Interactive Guide</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Cool Neutrals (White, Slate, Indigo) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tabbed interface (Simulacra, Hyperreality, Case Studies, Conclusion) is chosen over a linear report. This structure segments the abstract concepts, allowing users to explore them in a non-linear, self-directed way. The "Case Studies" tab, with its sub-navigation, turns passive reading about tech examples into an active user choice (clicking "Heygen," "Digital Twins," etc.), reinforcing the connection between theory and application. An interactive "Orders of Simulacra" and a "Stacked Reality" diagram will use simple HTML/CSS to visually represent the core frameworks. This design prioritizes conceptual clarity and user-driven exploration of philosophical ideas. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: "Orders of Simulacra" -> Goal: Organize -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive HTML/CSS cards. -> Interaction: JS onClick to reveal definitions. -> Justification: Breaks down a key framework into digestible, user-selectable parts. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS. Report Info: Tech Examples (Heygen, Digital Twins, Deepfakes) -> Goal: Organize/Compare -> Viz/Presentation: Tab-like buttons and a dynamic text area. -> Interaction: JS onClick to update text area content based on button pressed. -> Justification: Allows user to "query" the app for Baudrillard's analysis on specific tech, making it interactive. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS. Report Info: "Stacked Reality" concept -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz/Presentation: Styled, stacked HTML divs (Material, Digital, Symbolic). -> Interaction: CSS hover effects. -> Justification: Provides a simple, clear visual metaphor for the concluding concept. -> Library/Method: HTML/CSS. NO CHARTS (Chart.js/Plotly.js) are used as the source report contains no quantitative data, only philosophical concepts. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <p class="mb-6 text-slate-700">This section explores the concept of "simulacra"—representations or imitations that come to replace the very reality they were meant to represent. Jean Baudrillard outlined three "orders" or stages of simulacra, showing how the copy progressively detaches from the original. Interact with the cards below to see how this relationship evolves.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Simulacra</strong> (singular: simulacrum) are representations or imitations of people, things, or ideas that no longer have—or never had—a true original. The term is most often associated with Jean Baudrillard, who used it to describe how, in postmodern culture, symbols and signs replace reality itself.</p>

                <p class="mb-6 text-slate-700">When the simulation no longer just represents reality but *becomes* our reality, we enter the state of hyperreality. It's a condition where the distinction between the real and the representation collapses. This section defines this crucial concept and its implications.</p>
                <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <p class="text-lg"><strong>Hyperreality</strong> is the condition where the distinction between reality and its representation collapses—where simulations, media, and symbols feel more real or convincing than actual lived experience.</p>
                    <p>Baudrillard describes it as the state we enter when we interact with a world of models, images, and narratives that don’t point back to anything authentic, yet still shape how we perceive what’s “real.”</p>
                    <p>Think of examples like:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2">
                        <li>Theme parks designed to feel more authentically “American” than any real town.</li>
                        <li>Social media profiles curated until they seem more vivid than the person behind them.</li>
                        <li>AI-generated content that feels truer to human emotion than most human writing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="font-semibold">Hyperreality isn’t about deception—it’s about immersion in a convincing fiction that replaces the need for the original.</p>

                <p class="mb-6 text-slate-700">After exploring simulacra, hyperreality, and modern tech, we're left with a fundamental question. This final section offers a perspective on what "reality" might mean in our heavily mediated world, presenting it as a negotiated, multi-layered construction.</p>
                <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    <p class="text-lg">Maybe the honest answer is that “reality” today is <strong>negotiated more than observed</strong>.</p>
                    <p>It’s no longer a stable ground we stand on—it’s a shared construction, constantly revised through algorithms, feeds, and interfaces. We experience what’s most legible to our systems and our circles, not necessarily what’s most real.</p>
                    <p>If you borrow Baudrillard’s lens, we now live inside a <strong>stacked reality</strong>:</p>

                <p class="mt-8 text-center text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">“Reality” persists, but it’s filtered, ranked, and aestheticized before it reaches us. The challenge isn’t to peel back to some pure version; it’s to stay aware of which version we’re inhabiting, and who benefits from its construction.</p>
